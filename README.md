# GitOps (using Kustomize)

An example repo structure for GitOps with:

- [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux)
- [Helm Operator](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator)
- [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize)

## Directory structure

```
kustomize
├── base                        # base kustomizations             
│   ├── cert-manager            # logical grouping of resources
│   │ └── helmreleases          # base Helmreleases (may be layered with kustomisations)
│   │ └── kustomization.yaml    # Kustomization file which pulls in releases and patches, etc
├── dev                         # Directory per env which pulls from base and extends/overrides helmreleases
```

Resources are organised per environment in the `kustomize` directory.

## Pre-requisites

A list of pre-requisites can be found [here](docs/pre-reqs.md).

## Setup

1. To configure this to work with your repository first read the steps [here](docs/configuration.md).

2. Create a cluster using `make cluster`

3. Install [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux) and the [Helm Operator](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator) using `make install-flux`

4. After following the prompts, flux will establish a connection to your repository and start reconciling.

## Continuous Integration
